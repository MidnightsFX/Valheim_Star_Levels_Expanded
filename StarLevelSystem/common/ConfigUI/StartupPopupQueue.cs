    // The shared queue for popups that open by themselves on the main menu -- first-run tutorials, update

    // landing on the same frame.
    //
    // ============================================================================================
    // FROZEN CROSS-ASSEMBLY CONTRACT -- v1. Never change the shape of anything marked below.
    //
    // Same arrangement as QuickConfigBroker, and deliberately NOT part of it: every mod that copies
    // Common/Config/UI/ compiles its own StartupPopupQueue, the first copy to run creates a
    // DontDestroyOnLoad GameObject named QueueObjectName, and every copy after that reaches the component
    // on it by TYPE NAME and method SIGNATURE, through reflection -- see ConfigUIStartupPopups.
    //
    // Its own GameObject, not the broker's, for two reasons. The broker belongs to whichever copy loaded
    // first, so a queue added to it as a v3 method would be missing whenever an older copy won that race.
    // And ConfigUILauncher only ever adds a broker to a launcher object it created itself: had a queue
    // created that object first, every older copy would find no broker on it and lose the Mod Config
    // button without a word.
    //
    // Only BCL types cross the boundary. Func<bool> lives in mscorlib, which every copy shares.
    //
    // Amendment rules: ADDITIVE ONLY, exactly as for the broker. A newer caller probes for a newer method
    // with GetMethod(...) != null and degrades silently when it is absent.
